This is fully working. It is fully updated with what I talked about in the 2pm meeting on 5/15. When you are ready to connect your code with mine just send me a dm and I'll help you out. I ran this on VScode using the terminal.


In order to run:

Start Virtual Environment

recipe.py (database is provided)

Open the website at localhost:5000
